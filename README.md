Maps for plants at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers

I've been leading tours through the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park for a few years now and find it helps me 
remember stuff and dictate information to others when I can give it some context of where it is in the real world.  

So I tried to make a few maps w/ different tools and will post the links and basic code or process here if I have time.

If your epecially interested in anything I didn't explain or can tell me stupidities I've done and how to fix them get
in touch or just make the improvements yourself and show me!

Banana Map on Mapbox:

Data after a join to make it mapable on CartoDB https://mpmckenna8.cartodb.com/tables/banana_world_economic_ouput_unfao_copy/table


I did some vanilla and chocolate maps on Google MyMaps I'm not terribly proud of but will post some links to those
here once I trace down where I left em' on this here internet.


**Some map related blog posts I've Authored**

On the maps I'm currently hopeful I'm going to do some process blogging for. http://wanderingamerican8.blogspot.com/2013/09/maps-ive-been-makin.html
-One of the first thing I want to do before I do another CoF map is document the names for countries data wasn't available
for some plants and the Country names which cause trouble in joins from the UNfao datasets to my country polygons in
CartoDB.  

Instead of putting the stuff on mapbox I was thinking about trying my hand at some d3.js mapmaking.  Here's one of my
old post augmenting Mike Bostock's <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/">"Let's Make a Map" tutorial</a>. 
-my helper post http://wanderingamerican8.blogspot.com/2013/04/made-map-using-d3.html

Now I'm gonna brainstorm how I want to set this jam up....
